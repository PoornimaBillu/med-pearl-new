<p class="bodypara">What can healthcare organizations meaningfully do to address the epidemic of deep discouragement and burnout so many of our clinicians are experiencing?  Provide a single screen for medical knowledge and patient data.  Using MedPearl improves time to determine the best quality management and workup including ordering of first-line labs, imaging, and treatment. As a result, patients with undifferentiated complex problems arrive at the specialistâ€™s exam room having completed the work-up and first-line therapy that would have otherwise occurred at the first specialty visit.  Patients ultimately referred, then, are those most likely to need surgery or other interventions performed only by the specialist.</p>
